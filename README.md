# Book-Catalog-REST-API-with-Express.js

I developed a Book Catalog REST API using Express.js, a fast and flexible web application framework for Node.js. This project allows users to manage a collection of books with various details such as name, author, summary, publisher, year, page count, read page, and reading status. The API offers endpoints for adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting books.

Features:

    Add new books with comprehensive details including author, publisher, and reading status.
    Update book information, ensuring data accuracy and relevancy.
    Retrieve individual book information by ID, enabling precise data access.
    Delete books from the catalog, providing efficient data management.

Technologies used:

    Express.js: A robust Node.js web framework for building APIs and web applications.
    nanoid: A unique ID generator to ensure each book has a distinct identifier.
    RESTful API principles: Well-structured endpoints for consistent and efficient data manipulation.
